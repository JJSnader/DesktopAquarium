# DesktopAquarium
 This expands on my original project, (DesktopShark)[https://github.com/JJSnader/DesktopShark].  
 This allows you to see a list of all fish currently spawned (there will be more than just sharks soon)
 and to change their settings without needing to constantly close and reopen the app.  
 The shark cursor chomping mode is also vastly improved from the original Desktop Shark.
