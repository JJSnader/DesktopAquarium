# DesktopAquarium
This is a program to create and track the various fishes occupying your desktop.
## Currently Supported Fish
### **Shark**
 This expands on my original project, [DesktopShark](https://github.com/JJSnader/DesktopShark).  
 The shark cursor chomping mode is vastly improved from the original Desktop Shark.
### **Goldfish** 
 This is a basic fish designed to be eaten by other fish. However, that functionality doesn't exist yet, so they peacefully cohabitate in the current versions.
