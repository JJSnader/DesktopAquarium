# DesktopAquarium
This is a program to create and track the various fishes occupying your desktop.
## Currently Supported Fish
### **Shark**
 This expands on my original project, [DesktopShark](https://github.com/JJSnader/DesktopShark).  
 The shark cursor chomping mode is vastly improved from the original Desktop Shark.
### **Goldfish** 
 This is a basic fish designed to be eaten by other fish. However, that functionality doesn't exist yet, so they peacefully cohabitate in the current versions.
### **Jellyfish**
 Doesn't do much, but still looks kinda cool.
### **Pufferfish**
 Swims around like a normal fish, but if you right-click on him, he puffs up.
### **Submarine**
 An imposter pretending to be a fish. He gets angry if you interfere with his submarine moving.
### **Sperm Whale**
 A sperm whale who frequently talks to himself. If given the right name, he'll cosplay as a whale from a famous classic.
